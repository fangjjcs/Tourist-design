# Tourist Design System

This is a tourist recommendation system, we utilized Google Maps API for demonstrating the recommended route.
If Users run out of ideas when they are trying to plan a tourist. Users can use this website by inputing their scheduled sights and time, the system will help generating a next recommended sight for users based on big data analysis.

To note that this repository only contains front-end files (without google maps api).
